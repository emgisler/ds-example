Rather than build them from the ground up, he'd like to find a group of at least 5 yoga studios that he can purchase and put together into a chain.  The customer lives in Southern California and wants the yoga chain to be based in the Los Angeles area.  \n\nThe customer is willing to build his yoga empire inland if that is all he can find, but would prefer to have it closer to the coast.  The 5 yoga studios need to be relatively close to each other, preferably in the same neighborhood.  This customer is not concerned about price because he plans to make the current owners an offer they can't refuse."
